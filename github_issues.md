# GitHub Issues for EduCode

## Issue #1: Implement User Authentication System
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High

Currently, the application doesn't have a proper authentication system. We need to implement user registration, login, and profile management.

**Tasks:**
- Create login/signup pages
- Implement JWT authentication
- Add protected routes
- Create user profile page
- Add password reset functionality

## Issue #2: Fix Code Editor Language Selection Bug
**Type:** Bug
**Priority:** Medium

When changing languages in the code editor, sometimes the syntax highlighting doesn't update correctly. The editor shows JavaScript highlighting even when Python is selected.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Go to Code Editor page
2. Select Python from the dropdown
3. Observe that syntax highlighting still shows JavaScript patterns

## Issue #3: Improve Mobile Responsiveness
**Type:** Enhancement
**Priority:** Medium

Some components don't display correctly on mobile devices, particularly the code editor and documentation pages.

**Areas to improve:**
- Code editor layout on small screens
- Navigation menu on mobile
- Features grid layout
- Documentation tabs

## Issue #4: Add Backend Integration for Code Execution
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High

Currently, only JavaScript code can be executed in the browser. We need a backend service to compile and run code for other languages like Python, Java, and C++.

**Requirements:**
- Create a secure sandbox environment
- Implement API endpoints for code execution
- Add support for all advertised languages
- Implement proper error handling
- Add execution time limits

## Issue #5: Implement Search Functionality
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Medium

The search input in the Features page is currently non-functional. We need to implement proper search functionality to filter languages and resources.

**Tasks:**
- Add search logic to filter language cards
- Implement category filtering
- Add search highlighting
- Make search responsive

## Issue #6: Add Progress Tracking System
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Medium

Users need a way to track their learning progress across different courses and languages.

**Features needed:**
- Progress indicators for courses
- Completion badges
- Learning streaks
- Achievement system
- Dashboard with progress visualization

## Issue #7: Optimize Performance
**Type:** Enhancement
**Priority:** Low

The application has some performance issues, particularly with animations and rendering large code blocks.

**Areas to optimize:**
- Reduce bundle size
- Implement code splitting
- Optimize Framer Motion animations
- Lazy load components
- Implement virtualization for long lists

## Issue #8: Add Unit and Integration Tests
**Type:** Task
**Priority:** Medium

The project lacks proper test coverage. We need to implement unit and integration tests to ensure stability.

**Testing requirements:**
- Set up testing framework (Jest/React Testing Library)
- Write unit tests for components
- Add integration tests for key user flows
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Issue #9: Implement Dark/Light Theme Toggle
**Type:** Enhancement
**Priority:** Low

Currently, the application only has a dark theme. Users should be able to switch between dark and light themes.

**Requirements:**
- Add theme context
- Create theme toggle component
- Design light theme color palette
- Ensure all components support both themes

## Issue #10: Add Collaborative Coding Feature
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Low

Implement a collaborative coding environment where multiple users can work on the same code simultaneously.

**Features needed:**
